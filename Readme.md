# Neural Network from Scratch - Python

This repository contains a simple implementation of a neural network from scratch in Python using NumPy. The neural network is capable of performing binary or multiclass classification using the forward and backward propagation methods. Various functions are included for training, testing, and making predictions. Tested on the MNIST dataset.

## Features

- **Neural Network Architecture**: Implements a basic neural network with one hidden layer and one output layer.
- **Forward Propagation**: Propagates inputs through the network to get the final output.
- **Backpropagation**: Calculates gradients and updates weights and biases.
- **Gradient Descent**: Trains the network by optimizing weights and biases using gradient descent.
- **Prediction**: Makes predictions using the trained neural network.
- **Accuracy**: Measures the accuracy of the model on the training data.

## Results
Training Accuracy: After training, you should observe that the model achieves approximately 75% accuracy on the training data.
Testing Accuracy: Observed test accuracy is about 70%
